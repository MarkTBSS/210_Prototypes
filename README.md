Whether using prototypes directly or the class syntax in JavaScript is "better" depends on several factors, including the specific needs of your project, readability, maintainability, and the familiarity of your team with JavaScript concepts. Both approaches have their advantages and can be used effectively. Here's a comparison based on common considerations:

Readability and Syntax
Class Syntax: Offers a cleaner, more readable syntax that is familiar to developers coming from other object-oriented languages. It makes it easier to define constructors and methods, and to handle inheritance.
Prototypes: While more verbose and less intuitive for those unfamiliar with JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, using prototypes directly can offer more flexibility and control.

Inheritance
Class Syntax: Simplifies inheritance with the extends keyword, making it easier to create complex hierarchies.
Prototypes: Requires manually setting the prototype chain, which can be more cumbersome but offers a deeper understanding of JavaScript's inheritance model.

Performance
Class Syntax: Under the hood, classes are essentially syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. Therefore, there's no significant performance difference between classes and prototypes.
Prototypes: Direct manipulation of prototypes might offer slight optimizations in some cases, but such differences are usually negligible.

Encapsulation and Private Properties
Class Syntax: Recent additions to the language (e.g., private fields using #) allow better encapsulation within classes.
Prototypes: Encapsulation can be achieved through closures, but it's not as straightforward or elegant as using class syntax.

Compatibility
Class Syntax: Requires ES6 support, which is available in all modern environments but might be a concern for legacy systems without transpilation.
Prototypes: Works in all JavaScript environments, as it's been part of the language since the beginning.

Conclusion
If you value readability and are working in a modern JavaScript environment, or if you come from a class-based language, using the class syntax might be preferable.
If you need or want a deeper understanding of JavaScript's unique features, or if you're working in environments where ES6 support cannot be guaranteed, you might opt for direct manipulation of prototypes.

Ultimately, the choice between using classes or prototypes in JavaScript should be based on the specific requirements of your project, your team's familiarity with JavaScript, and the development environment. Both are valid and powerful ways to work with objects and inheritance in JavaScript.
